# Introduction for new Research Assistants

The goal of this project is to provide an ever developing introduction to new research assistants at Department of Economics, University of Copenhagen. The repository introduces the statistical languages `SAS` and `Stata`. Furthermore a short introduction to scripting is also provided, because I have found this very useful when developing larger projects. The main project is contained in [IntroductionResearchAssistants.Rmd](IntroductionResearchAssistants.Rmd) that is in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document that requires [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and the template is nicely provided by the package [pinp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pinp).
